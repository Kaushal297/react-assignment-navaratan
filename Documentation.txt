In this Assigment we have two routers :
a) / => This route is for login where we can see the username,password & remember me layout
b) /order => This router contains all the functionality for orders which are View, New, Edit, Delete.


work-flow:
=> when we are on the main page which is "/" we get to see the basic login box where the layout has been completed but not the functionality.
=> To go order Page, We need to manually go the URL and enter '/order' (because authentication is not done yet - workaround solution)

My Approach:
=> First i wanted to work on the core functionality for the Assigment that was orders page : View, Add, Edit & Delete functionality
=> then i have created the mocked/Dummy Data to show the list of orders
=> then worked on delete functionality, for this i have passed the order number and filtering it out based on that and removing it from the orders State.
=> then i have created the popUp using the react-bootstrap, this same popUp is been reused for create, Edit & delete(to show last warning)
=> then i started working on the create order here i had to generate the order number either randomly or serialized. i choose to go with randomly since it is a small assignment
=> after that created the inputs required in order to show that in the list of orders
=> then assigned the useState hook to get & set the values for the required field.
=> adding that to the orders data.
=> then i moved to edit, here i have reused the same layout which was there for the create new order and passed down the values into it.
=> checked for if the order has previously been created or not if so then no need to assign the value to it.
